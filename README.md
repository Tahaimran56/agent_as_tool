🗣️ Multilingual Agent Router (English & Roman Urdu)
This project is a Python-based assistant that detects user language (English or Roman Urdu) and routes the input to a specialized agent accordingly. It uses the Gemini-compatible OpenAI API and supports modular, asynchronous design via the agents framework.

🚀 Features
🌐 Language Detection (English vs. Roman Urdu)

🤖 Specialized Agents for Each Language

🔁 Tool Routing via a Main Agent

⚡ Async support using AsyncOpenAI

🔐 Environment-based API configuration

🧠 How It Works
The main agent (main_agent) detects the language of the user input.

Based on the detected language:

English input is routed to english_agent.

Roman Urdu input is routed to roman_urdu_agent.

Each agent has its own instructions and response style.

Output is returned from the selected agent and displayed to the user.
